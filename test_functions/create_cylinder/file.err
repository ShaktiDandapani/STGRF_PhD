 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.047   TIME= 00:54:18
 Structural elements without mid nodes usually produce much more         
 accurate results in quad or brick shape.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.156   TIME= 00:54:20
 Volume 1 is being meshed entirely with SOLID185 tetrahedra, which can   
 be much less accurate than bricks.  Use quadratic (10-node) tetrahedra  
 if available.                                                           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      40.000   TIME= 00:54:52
 Shape testing revealed that 95 of the 2793671 new or modified elements  
 violate shape warning limits.  To review test results, please see the   
 output file or issue the CHECK command.
